mapping:
  # Data Parallel Mapping:
  # - Model weights are fully replicated in each PE.
  # - The workload is partitioned across PEs along the batch dimension (N).
  # - LocalBuffer reuses input activations temporally within each PE.
  
  # Temporal mapping on the LocalBuffer:
  - target: LocalBuffer
    type: temporal
    factors: [R, P]
    permutation: [R, P]

  # Spatial mapping on the MACs:
  - target: MAC
    type: spatial
    factors: [N]
